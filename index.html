  <h1>Why Own A PC</h1>
  <p>Having a PC can be the ultimate device you can possibly own, from the wide range of tasks you can accomplish this can be seen as a tool. PC's are used to play games, but they are also used to go to college and most PC's can be setup and worked on from home. The uses are endless for a PC. </p>

  <h1>Pros and Cons of Each Type</h1>

  <h2><i>Desktops</i></h2>
  <p>&#9989;<b> Can have the most power since airflow and space are way more effective</b></p>
  <p>&#9989; <b>Repairs are more simple and can be done by yourself cheaply</b></p>
  <p>&#9989; <b>Typically cheaper to buy parts</b></p>
  <p>&#9989; <b>Long life spans</b></p>
  <p>&#9989; <b>Allows major upgrades</b></p>
  <p>&#10060; <b>Not portable so can't be taken anywhere</b></p>
  <p>&#10060; <b>Need to get peripherals which are added costs leading to over $200</b></p>
  <p>&#10060; <b>Fragile when it comes to shipping</b></p>

  <h2><i>Laptops</i></h2>
  <p>&#9989; <b>Portable</b></p>
  <p>&#9989; <b>Doesn't need many peripherals except for a mouse for gaming</b></p>
  <p>&#9989; <b>Comes with a screen</b></p>
  <p>&#9989; <b>Sleek and powerful</b></p>
  <p>&#10060; <b>Most be plugged in for most power</b></p>
  <p>&#10060; <b>Starts to lose speed after 3-5 years</b></p>
  <p>&#10060; <b>Battery lifes start to lose charge giving you less time on the go</b></p>
  <p>&#10060; <b>Repairs are not simple</b></p>
  <p>&#10060; <b>Not a lot of big upgrades when it comes to increasing performance</b></p>

  <h1>Which Should You Get?</h1>
  <p>Making a choice may seem very difficult since both have pros and cons to them. I would say if you live an active life style where you travel or are in the military a laptop your way to go, although they regress after years and aren't as powerful as desktops the portable aspect of them will save you more time and money. If you live in a stable spot and don't move around a lot a desktop will be a much perferred item since you can get more power for gaming and have better multi-tasking functions.</p>
