<h1>How To Build a PC</h1>

<p>Building a PC may seem like a scary tasks to do, but I'm here to tell you that it's all a myth. Yes, you too can build a PC. All you need to do is have patience with yourself and although parts can be fragile and hard to connect you have to keep a clear mind and understand mistakes will happen.
Rome was not built in a single day so your new PC build won't be built in 20 minutes. It will be very rewarding when you finish and it's not nearly as bad as you think. It would take a very long time to explain how to so I will link a video showing how to do it. </p>

<h1>Common Problems and solutions</h1>
<p>Issue: PC will not turn on after build is made. Solution: Make sure PSU cables are properly set and then try flicking the power button on the box.</p>
<p>Issue: CPU running hot. Solution: Make sure CPU has enough thermal paste on or plastic film is removed.</p>
<p>Issue: Case running hot. Solution: Make sure fans are facing right way and pulling from the front and pushing out the back</p>
<p>Issue: Bad computer performance. Solution: Make sure RAM is set in channels 2 and 4 for optimal usage.</p>
